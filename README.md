## IRC-Tracker
### Build for SHS Hacks 2022

This Project is for students who want to check their grades but don't want to constantly have to go to the IRC D125 website.
Using text messages through Twilio, users can check all of their current grades, their grades in each standard for different classes, and the grades for all of their assignments in a single standard. Anytime they want to check thier grades, all they have to do is text the Twilio number.

The instructions on how to use the project are on the website they use to sign up. 
The differnet commands a user can use are messaged to them after they sign up.    

### Further Improvements: 
- Notification message alerts when new assignments are added & graded on the Grading System, a **highly requested feature from many students**.
- A set time at when the user's grades are texted to them, such as once a week, once a day, or at the end of a semester.
